    For the past 12 years I have lived and worked in Jakarta Indonesia as a teacher. I have taught a wide variety of subject from English to physics. As my family and I prepare for our move back stateside, I have come to the decision that I need a career change. I am a self-taught front end developer. My journey has led me to find a passion for React and styled components. While I am not very confident or strong in design, I thoroughly enjoy the development aspect of building websites and web-apps.
